## Your Alarm App on iOS with the which will not let you forget anything anymore

---

Thanks to AVFoundation the app will record a memo and set a trigger time at the which you will hear your record. 
So when your new favorite alarm ring, it won't hurt your feeling with the buzzy ring on iOS. 
But a meaningfull speach done by the master of your feelings, **yourself**.
